In the context of software or information modeling, 
a happy path (sometimes called happy flow) is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions. 
For example, the happy path for a function validating credit card numbers would be where none of the validation rules raise an error, 
thus letting execution continue successfully to the end, generating a positive response.

Process steps for a happy path are also used in the context of a use case. 
In contrast to the happy path, process steps for alternate paths and exception paths may also be documented.
